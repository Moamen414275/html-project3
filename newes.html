    <h1>Basic Types of Runs</h1>

            <h3>Recovery Run</h3>
            <p>A recovery run is a relatively short run performed at an easy pace. Recovery runs serve to add a little mileage to a runner’s training without taking away from performance in the harder, more important workouts that precede and follow them. Recovery runs are best done as the next run after a hard workout such as an interval run.</p>

        <div class="col">
            <img src="images/base.jpg" alt="base">
            <h3>Base Run</h3>
            <p> A base run is a relatively short to moderate-length run undertaken at a runner’s natural pace. While individual base runs are not meant to be challenging, they are meant to be done frequently, and in the aggregate they stimulate big improvements in aerobic capacity, endurance, and running economy. Base runs will make up a bulk of your weekly training mileage.</p>

        <div class="col">
            <img src="images/long.jpg" alt="long">
            <h3>Long Run</h3>
            <p>Generally, a long run is a base run that lasts long enough to leave a runner moderately to severely fatigued. The function of a long run is to increase raw endurance. The distance or duration required to achieve this effect depends, of course, on your current level of endurance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img src="images/progression.jpg" alt="Progression">
            <h3>Progression Run</h3>
            <p>A progression run is a run that begins at a runner’s natural pace and ends with a faster segment at anywhere from marathon down to 10K pace. These runs are generally intended to be moderately challenging—harder than base runs but easier than most threshold and interval runs</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img src="images/fartlek.jpg" alt="Fartlek">
            <h3>Fartlek</h3>
            <p>A fartlek workout is a base run that mixes in intervals of varying duration or distance. It’s a good way to begin the process of developing efficiency and fatigue resistance at faster speeds in the early phases of the training cycle, or to get a moderate dose of fast running later in the training cycle in addition to the larger doses provided by tempo/threshold and interval workouts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img src="images/hill.jpg" alt="Hill Repeats">
            <h3>Hill Repeats</h3>
            <p>Hill repeats are repeated short segments of hard uphill running. They increase aerobic power, high-intensity fatigue resistance, pain tolerance, and run-specific strength. The ideal hill on which to run hill repeats features a steady, moderate gradient of 4 to 6 percent.</p>
